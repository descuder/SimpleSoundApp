This project, implemented using ActionScript3 and AdobeAir, gives you some ideas about:
1. How to make a simple sound recorder.
2. How to perform the Speech to Text (STT) transformation and vice-versa (Text to Speech, TTS).
It's just a student project, so I'm willing to receive any comments/advices.

Thank you!
